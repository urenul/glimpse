# Run by FetchContent in kColorPicker's and kImageAnnotator's source
# directories, for the export header named by EXPORT_HEADER. On Windows they
# define their export macro as nothing, leaving MinGW to export everything on
# its own; users then take a class's member functions from import stubs,
# whose addresses differ from the library's own. Qt finds a signal by
# comparing those addresses, so connecting to one of their signals by
# pointer fails ("signal not found"): kImageAnnotator never heard of a color
# picked in kColorPicker, and so could not keep it. Windows now gets
# dllexport/dllimport like everyone else.
